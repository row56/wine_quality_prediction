## Red wine quality dataset:
### Source:

- Kaggle:

- UCI machine learning repository:

### Synopsis: 
The dataset contains physiochemical properties of red wine alongside with a quality score 
(target variable) based on sensory data. The dataset scores are not distributed equally, since 
there a lot more “normal” quality wines than “poor” or “excellent” quality wines. 

### Number of observations: 1599

### Variables:

| Variable Name         | Description       | Data type  |
| :---:                 | :---:             | :---:      |
| Fixed acidity         |most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily) | Continuous |
| Volatile acidity      |mount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste | Continuous |
| Citric acid           |found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines| Continuous |
| Residual sugar        |amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet | Continuous |
| Chlorides             |amount of salt in the wine| Continuous |
| Free sulfur dioxide   |free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine| Continuous |
| Total sulfur dioxide  |amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine| Continuous |
| Density               |density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content| Continuous |
| pH                    |describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale, (Paul: pH is logarithmic as far as I know)| Continuous |
| Sulphates             |a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant| Continuous |
| Alcohol               |ethanol| Continuous |
| Quality               | Target variable   | Discrete    |

## ML Methods for the task:
- Non-linear models (Spline smoothing) 
- Pursuit projection regression
